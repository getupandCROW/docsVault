## Python for Web Development

- **[[TurboGears]]** is a Python web app framework built to improve upon the limitations of other web app frameworks such as [[Django]] and [[Rails]]. It can start as a single file app and scale to a full-stack solution for more complex apps.
	- TurboGears uses an [[ORM]] with multi-database support, support for horizontal data partitioning (sharding), a new widget system that makes building [[AJAX]] apps easier, and designer-friendly template system.
	- [TurboGears2 Website 3.0 documentation](http://www.turbogears.org/)

- **[[Pyramid]]** is a lightweight Python framework that wants to make small [[Web App]]s into big Web Apps. Apart from scaling web apps, Pyramid is also great for prototyping your ideas and for developers who are working on [[API]] projects. The framework has been used by tech giants such as [[Mozilla]], [[SurveyMonkey]], [[Yelp]], and [[Dropbox]].
	- Because it's so lightweight, Pyramid is a great framework if you're starting out. But its configuration, extension, and add-on system allow the framework to scale seamlessly with your app.
	- [Welcome to Pyramid, a Python Web Framework](https://trypyramid.com/)

- **[[Flask]]** is a Python micro-framework based on [[Werkzeug]]. It comes with a built-in development server and debugger, integrated unit testing support, [[RESTful]] request dispatching, and more.
	- Flask is 100% WSGI 1.0 compliant and [[Unicode]]-based. It's used by big companies such as [[LinkedIn]] and [[Pinterest]].
	- [Welcome to Flask — Flask Documentation (2.0.x)](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

- **[[Bottle]]** is a fast and lightweight WSGI Python micro-framework. It implements everything in a single source file and has no dependencies apart from the Python Standard Library.
	- Bottle's default features include a basic abstraction over the WSGI standard, utilities, templating, and routing. [[Netflix]] uses the framework to build its web interfaces.
	- [Bottle: Python Web Framework — Bottle 0.13-dev documentation](https://bottlepy.org/)

- **[[Web2py]]** is a full-stack web framework for database-driven apps. It comes with its own web-based [[IDE]] that includes a code editor, a debugger and one-click deployment.
	- Web2py works cross-platform. You can run it on [[Windows]], [[Mac]], [[Linux]]/[[Unix]], [[Amazon EC2]], and [[Google App Engine]]. It has support for internationalization and a ticketing framework that issues a ticket when a mistake occurs.
	- [Web2py Homepage](http://www.web2py.com/)

- **[[Django]]** is a full-stack, high-level Python web framework that allows developers to create complex applications quickly and efficiently. Some of its key features are its authentication mechanism, URL routing, template engine, [[ORM|Object-Relational Mapper]], and database schema migrations.
	- Django is written entirely from scratch and does not rely on other Python libraries. Its design philosophy is based on loose coupling between the various layers of the framework, as little code as possible, quick development, and as little redundancy as possible.

## Python for [[ML|Machine Learning]], [[AI|Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Data Science]]

[[Keras]] is a neural network library. It can run on top of [[TensorFlow]], [[Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit]], or [[PlaidML]]. It's considered one of the best tools for those who are beginning their journey into [[Machine Learning]], because it's much more readily understandable than other ML libraries.
- Keras has four main principles: user-friendliness, modularity, extensibility, and computability. However, it's not as fast as other Python libraries.
- [Keras: the Python deep learning API](https://keras.io/)

Pattern is a web mining module for Python. It has tools for scraping, [[NLP|Natural Language Processing]], [[Machine Learning]], network analysis, and visualization.

- The module is free and is bundled with 50+ examples and 350+ unit tests.
- [Pattern – platform{DH}](https://platformdh.uantwerpen.be/index.php/projects/pattern/)
