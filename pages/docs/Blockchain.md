Centralized Finance (CeFi) or Decentralized (DeFi) exchanges

	Centralized exchanges were the norm in the crypto world until decentralized exchanges arrived. With centralized exchanges, you don’t have your own private keys, and the exchange is the custodian for storing your funds. Decentralized exchanges are peer-to-peer, and there’s no intermediary.

How to invest in Blockchain Technology

- **Buy crypto hardware and mine cryptocurrency yourself**. While Bitcoin mining requires a large capital outlay, there are other tokens you can mine for a reasonably low barrier to entry. For example, Helium miners cost roughly $500 and mint HNT using the ‘proof of coverage’ consensus protocol to verify new blocks. Get started with cryptocurrency mining by reading our [short guide on Bitcoin mining](https://blockgeeks.com/what-is-bitcoin-mining-an-easy-guide/).

- Invest in mining pools. An alternative to mining cryptocurrency yourself is to join a mining pool. Mining pools pool together the computational power of others on the network to improve the chances of mining a block. The rewards for all blocks mined are shared among miners in the pool. [Slush Pool](https://slushpool.com/home/) is a popular mining pool.

- **Contrarian Investing:** Contrarian investors purposely go against the market sentiment. They buy when people are selling and sell when people are buying.By following the [Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/bitcoin-fear-and-greed-index/), you can get a good idea of the prevailing sentiment in the Bitcoin market and then do the opposite: buy when people are fearful and sell when they’re greedy (_see Fear & Greed Index below)_.

## What Is PoS?
- PoS still uses cryptographic algorithms for validation, but transactions get validated by a chosen validator based on how many coins they hold, also known as their stake.
- Individuals aren’t technically mining, and there’s no block reward. Instead, blocks are ‘forged.’ Those participating in this process lock a specific number of coins on the network.
- The bigger a person’s stake, the more mining power they have—and the higher the chances they’ll be selected as the validator for the next block.
- To ensure those with the most coins aren’t always selected, other selection methods are used. These include **randomized block selection** (forgers with the highest stake and lowest [hash value](http://blockgeeks.com/guides/cryptographic-hash-functions/) are chosen) and **coin age selection** (forgers are selected based on how long they’ve held their coins)
- The results are faster transaction times and lower costs. The NEO and Dash cryptocurrencies, for example, can send and receive transactions in seconds.

## Blockchain or Scalability Trilemma: Decentralization, Security, and Scalability

- **Trustless**: The blockchain is immutable and automates trusted transactions between counterparties who do not need to know each other. Transactions are only executed when programmed conditions are met by both parties.

- **Immutable**: Records on a blockchain cannot be changed or tampered with – Bitcoin has never been hacked. A new block of transactions is only added after a complex mathematical problem is solved and verified by a consensus mechanism. Each new block has a unique cryptographic key resulting from the previous block’s information and key being added into a formula.

- **Decentralized**: No single entity maintains the network. Unlike centralized banks, decisions on the blockchain are made via consensus. Decentralization is essential because it ensures people can easily access and build on the platform, and there are multiple points of failure.

- **Lower Cost**: In the traditional finance system, you pay third parties like banks to process transactions. The blockchain eliminates these intermediaries and reduces fees, with some systems returning fees to miners and stakers.

- **Universal Banking**: [2 Billion](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/sites/globalfindex/files/chapters/2017%20Findex%20full%20report_chapter2.pdf) people globally do not have a bank account. Because anyone can access the blockchain to store money, it’s a great way to bank the unbanked and protect against theft that can happen due to holding cash in physical locations.

# Research Reports

	After we go through a phase of research, we need a way to share the findings with our team. Since we collect so much helpful data in one test, [a research report](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/reporting-usability-test-results.html) is a nice way for us to share results in full detail.

	There are a few reasons for this:

	-   The results can be used to guide future product decisions, and build things that customers will find helpful
	-   It gives your team an opportunity to empathise with their customers
	-   Over time, they’ll prove the value of getting early feedback from customers

	Reports contain a rich variety of information. They’re heavy on the text, and often use diagrams and tables of data to explain things. If your research involved speaking to customers (or test participants) then there may even be video clips of them talking about or using the product.
	
	Remember your audience (your colleagues)
	
	-	Avoid acronyms and buzz words. If you do use one, make sure to define it the first time you use it. For example, _minimum viable product (MVP)_. You can also add a glossary of key terms in your report’s appendix.
	-	Explain things that may seem obvious. Again, you can include links to do the explaining for you in the appendix.
	-	Check that it will be readable. Can you read it on both desktop and mobile? Do all the links go to the right places? Do you need access to a specific tool to see the results?
	
	Make your findings digestable

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System

- https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
- www.bitcoin.org

Abstract

- Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the mainbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
- We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
- The network timestamps transactions by **hashing** them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work.

- The longest chain serves as proof of the sequence of events and that is came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as the majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that **NOT** are cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.
- Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will. Upon return, they accept the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

Transactions

- electronic coin - a chain of digital signatures
- similar to [[Syncthing]]
- "mint" based model
	- transactions myst be publicly announced

Timestamp Server

- works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing he hash, such as in a Usenet post or physical newspaper
	- proves that he data must have existed at the time (by getting the hash)
	- each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash (forming a chain)

Proof-of-Work

- to implement a distributed timestamp server on a p2p basis
- PoW involves scanning for a value that when hashed (like with SHA-256) begins with a # of zero bits
	- workload grows exponential with the # of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash
	- increment a nonce ("Number Only Used Once", random value that is generated anew for each use) in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits
- solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making
	- not 1-IP=1-Vote
		- essentially is 1-CPU=1-Vote
			- majority decision is represented by CPU with the longest chain
- to compensate for increasing hardware speed, the PoW difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average # of blocks/hr
	- If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases
	- (so faster hardware that outperforms the average is less likely to be chosen to process the hash) ? - *my words*

Network

- The steps to run the network are as follows:
	1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
	2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
	3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
	4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
	5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
	6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in thechain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

- Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working onextending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, somenodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the otherbranch will then switch to the longer one.
- New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reachmany nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of droppedmessages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block andrealizes it missed one.

Incentive

- The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able toassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using itto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought tofind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins thaneveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.
