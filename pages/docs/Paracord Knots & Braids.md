# Paracord Knots & Braids

##### Table of Contents

```toc
```

***

The knot we are covering today is rare and quite exotic. It was covered by Luis Alberto Flores in one of his books (which are really hard to find). It originates from among Argentinian braiders who are world famous for their skill. The knot we will take a look at resembles a gaucho knot, at least in my opinion. It can be used to decorate a variety of projects. Knife lanyards and key fobs are the first that come to mind for me.

### The tutorial

We will need a single strand of cord to tie the knot.

![Heart Paracord Key Fob #howto (1)|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/flat-gaucho-knot-1.jpg)

***
Start by making a loop. Pass the working end under the standing end.

![Flat Gaucho Knot 2|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/flat-gaucho-knot-2.jpg)

***
Pass over the standing end, then under and through the loop (so under-over).

![Flat Gaucho Knot 3|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/flat-gaucho-knot-3.jpg)

## Paracord Pouch

Making a paracord pouch to protect your riches! After losing three baby bottles in under a year as well as a broken phone, all due to fall damage, I decided that I better start wrapping valuables, especially technology in paracord wraps. That or get another job to pay off the stuff we break I suppose.

After losing three baby bottles in under a year as well as a broken phone, all due to fall damage, I decided that I better start wrapping valuables, especially technology in paracord wraps. That or get another job to pay off the stuff we break I suppose.

#### After mumbling,

> *this is why we can’t have nice things...* 

#### I went to work.

The result is this paracord pouch I am about to show you. It is appropriate for holding various rectangular objects. For a more classic pouch design see [my dice bag tutorial](https://www.paracordguild.com/paracord-dice-bag/).

### How to make a paracord pouch 
![paracord pouch instructions|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/paracord-pouch-instructions.jpg)

The process of making this style of pouch is divided in two parts. In part one we make the sides by making a series of cobra knots (see my [cobra paracord bracelet tutorial](https://www.paracordguild.com/cobra-paracord-bracelet/) if you are not familiar with these). I make them so a small loop remains at the top.

In the second part we will be weaving the front and back side using a lacing needle. This is done by the process shown below. After everything is in place I remove the slack cord and straighten up everything so it looks like it should.

When done, I take the two cords used to make the front and back and tie a [lanyard knot](https://www.paracordguild.com/how-to-make-a-lanyard-knot/) with them. I can then use the lanyard knot and the loop to close the pouch easily.

The first part of this tutorial shows you how to make the sides:

After making the sides we continue by making the front and back. This is done by weaving, which can be summed up as going over and under cords. Using lacing needle will brighten up your day!

## Paracord Watch Band
![paracord watch band|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/paracord-watch-band.jpg "Paracord watch strap")

In this tutorial I will show you one of the ways of making a paracord watch band.

In fact, there are quite a few ways of making a paracord watch band. Many use the [fishtail weave](https://www.paracordguild.com/fishtail-paracord-bracelet/), the [ladder rack](https://www.paracordguild.com/trilobite-paracord-bracelet/) and the [cobra knot](https://www.paracordguild.com/cobra-paracord-bracelet/) for their watch bands.

I wanted something a bit more creative for this project, so I used [the cross knot](https://www.paracordguild.com/cross-knot/).

The cheap leather straps this watch came with were quite frustrating to fix, so I decided to make a strap using paracord 550. The idea of making a lighter, more appealing bracelet made for a nice little project.

![paracord watch band|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/paracord-watch-band-1024x545.jpg "Paracord watch strap")

### How to make a paracord watch band
![paracord watchband|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/paracord-watchband-300x159.jpg "Paracord watch strap")

To make this style of watch band I used two pieces of cord. Each has three cross knots on it when finished.

I started out by using a larks head knot to attach the first piece of cord (folded in half, naturally). After that I made a cross knot as close to the larks head knot as possible to make sure that the knot keeps the form it is supposed to have. I used a bit of spacing between the knots, but you could easily make more knots or even have no spaces at all between them. After I made the last knot I cut the ends and melted them. The last knot will be used to go through the loop.

![paracord watchband|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/paracord-watchband.jpg "Paracord watch strap")

The other side of the watch band is made a bit differently. I start by leaving a bit of space for a loop, so that the cross knot from the other side can be inserted through and close the watch band. The loop is a bit smaller than usually, since the cross knot is smaller than most stopper knots.

The cross knots are then lined up the same way the first strap was made.

I finish the band by making a cow-hitch knot and melt the ends together (I used the cow-hitch knot in my [paracord dice bag tutorial](https://www.paracordguild.com/paracord-dice-bag/), for those not familiar with it). I then tuck the joined ends under the knot.

Now, on to some images!

## Paracord - How to Start a Braid
![step 1 plait braid|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step1-plait-300x160.jpg "Woven start 1") ![step 2 plait braid|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step2-plait-300x160.jpg "Woven start 2") ![Woven step 3|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step3-plait.jpg "Woven start 3") 

In this tutorial I will show you a few common ways you can use to start a braid.  
Starting a braid becomes interesting mostly when plaiting over a core. When braiding without a core, usually a knot is used at the start to keep cords in line.

When plaiting, you have an abundance of way to start your plait. In general, little focus is put on this beginning, mostly because the start is most likely covered using a decorative knot. In some cases, like in whips, the start may even be secured and cut/sawed off.  

The examples below are just a few ways you can use to start your plaiting, if you wish to have a systematic way of doing it. Some are simple, some a bit more advanced.

### A woven start

![step 3 plait braid|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step3-plait-1024x545.jpg)

A woven start is made by interlocking your cords in a woven pattern. This will result in a plaited pattern.

![step 1 plait braid|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step1-plait.jpg "Woven start, part 1") 

![step 2 plait braid|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step2-plait.jpg "Woven start, part 2")

### Simple wrap around
![Step 1 of the wrap around braid|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step1-300x160.jpg) ![Step 2 of the wrap around braid|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step2-300x160.jpg)

The wrap around is useful mostly because it is easy and fast to do. A good choice.

![Wrap around, an easy start for a braid.|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step1.jpg "Wrap around, an easy start for a braid.") 

A second set has been tucked under the wrap, as shown by the two black cords.

![Step 2 of the wrap around braid|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/step2.jpg "Step 2 of the wrap around")

### Tied on ends
![Tied on ends. Simple and effective braid start - Paracord|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-start-a-braid-around-a-core.jpg)

Tied on ends are an option when starting a plait using the entire length of the working cord. Tying the ends off with a piece of rope or cord is all there is needed. Later on, the ends are covered with a decorative knot.

![Start a braid around a core - Paracord Simple Braid|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-start-a-braid-around-a-core-1024x545.jpg)

### No start
![No start, just plaiting|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-start-a-plait.jpg)

Often, I will not employ any technique, but placing my cords over the core and start plaiting.

![How to start a Plait 10 Paracord Braid|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-start-a-plait-1024x545.jpg)

### Turk’s head start for a braid
![Turk's head start of a braid|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-start-a-braid-with-a-turks-head.jpg)

Using a 3 part Turk’s head to start your braid is decorative as well as functional.

![how-to-start-a-braid-with-a-turks-head|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-start-a-braid-with-a-turks-head-1024x545.jpg)

### Spanish ring knot start for a braid

The Spanish ring knot, made with the ends of your cords is a secure and beautiful way to start a braid. You need to learn it, but once you have it down, this is a useful technique that does not require a covering knot.

![how to start a braid with a Spanish ring knot|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/how-to-start-a-braid-with-a-spanish-ring-knot-1024x545.jpg)

## Paracord Key Fob
![heart paracord key fob blue red|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-blue-300x160.jpg) ![heart paracord key fob (6)|200](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-green-300x160.jpg)

Let’s make a love themed paracord key fob!  
Today’s project is done in macrame. Using a simple knot multiple times we can get a nice looking “I heart you” pattern going. This is an ideal gift for Valentine’s day and pretty much any other day of the year!

![Heart Keyfob Paracord Black-Red|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-black-red.jpg "Paracord key fob heart pattern") 

***
The main knot for this project is the double half hitch, which I use 160 times! The key fob has 20 rows and each row consists out of 8 knots.  
I would consider this project about medium in difficulty. While the technique is simple to learn, you do need to do a number of knots, which takes patience and persistence. But hey, if you put a lot of work into it, it kinda shows you care as well, does it not?

![Heart Keyfob Paracord Blue-Red|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-blue.jpg "Paracord key fob heart blue red")

### Supplies needed

The supplies for this key fob are really basic. A few cords and a bit of hardware.

As far as the cords you will need, I recommend using cords 1-1.5 mm in diameter. The thicker the cords, the larger the key fob. In my case I am using cord 1.2 mm in diameter, which worked really well. So, you will need the following:

-   1 piece of [micro cord](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paracordfrien-20&keywords=micro%20cord&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=xm2&linkId=d3a82e69cc945dbb50324ec03790b783) for the pattern. 
	-   This one is 5 feet long (1.5 meters) and usually red.
-   4 pieces of micro cord, each 4.5 feet long (1.35 meters). 
	-   These can be black, blue, green. A nice contrast with red is recommended.
-   a piece of hardware for attachment to your keys. 
	-   You can use a [key ring](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paracordfrien-20&keywords=key%20ring&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=xm2&linkId=05b668b1d070679638b456377d28e32a) 
	-   or a [lobster claw hook](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=paracordfrien-20&keywords=lobster%20claw%20hook&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=xm2&linkId=c5c84471267e9b8ffb8e6ba3d6207cf8).
-   scissors and a lighter are the last items you will need. They are used to cut and melt your cords.

### “I heart U” key fob tutorial

#### Love Paracord Key Fob

Below you will find a full picture tutorial as well as a video one. The first few rows of the key fob are demonstrated in more detail, so that you get to know the basic knot- the double half hitch.

![love paracord key fob|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-1024x545.jpg "Paracord Key Fob")

Then, after a few rows, we will speed things up, while still being quite clear at what needs doing.

![attach 4 main cords](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-1.jpg "Paracord Key Fob")

***
Start by attaching your 4 main cords onto your key ring or hook. For this task we use the Lark’s head knot. We end up with 8 working ends.

![bring the cord around and over your ends (this is now the *guiding cord*)](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-2.jpg "Paracord Key Fob")

Place your other, pattern cord over your ends. I call this one the guiding cord.

***
We will now begin tying. Remember that each row has 8 knots in it.

![Work Left to Right, use a double half hitch and attach your first end on to the guiding cord](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/heart-paracord-key-fob-3.jpg "Paracord Key Fob")

## Paracord Belt

In this tutorial I demonstrate how to make a braided paracord belt.

I really like how braided belts look like. Sadly they are a bit underused and I think this is mostly due to the fact that braids are a pain to end.

Still though, I’d like to show you a few tips and tricks in making a braided belt that may spice up your paracord crafts.

Making a belt is very practical after all. A paracord belt holds a lot more paracord than any bracelet could as well as being an asset. Pants are quite a widespread piece of clothing after all :).

So with that said, let’s first take a look at the braiding technique that was used in making this belt. It is the [11 strand flat braid](https://www.paracordguild.com/11-strand-flat-braid-gaucho-style/) which I have already covered in the past. I really wanted to try it out and finally I got the chance.

#### The supplies

-   paracord 550 in two colors. This is an 11 strand braid. The braid takes up about 70% more cord than the length of the belt, so for a 4 foot belt expect to use about 7 feet of cord per strand
-   a belt buckle I used one that is 1 3/8 inches wide
-   a belt end tip to finish the ends
-   scissors
-   lighter.

### Making the belt

You will need 6 strands of one color and 5 strands of another, a total of 11 strands. For this I first determined the length of the belt I wanted, than added 75% more to each strand.

Note that I did not actually cut 11 separate strands. I used cow hitches to attach the core to the buckle. I used 3 double pieces of cord to make the 6 cords on the one side and 2 double cords and one regular one on the other side to make up the 5.

Before I cut I planned out how to attach these cords to the buckle. With the width of the buckle I was using I was able to use 2 cow hitches on each side of the buckle, which meant I was able to attach 8 cords easily. I added the rest as shown in the images below.

The left side:

6 cords on the left.

The right side was done similarly, with the last cord being spliced into itself to secure it.

Before moving on to actually braiding the belt, you need to decide if you are going to use a belt loop. I decided on a braided belt loop made with the [3 pass Spanish ring knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPzZooEf2sY).

Then, the braiding is done to reach the desired length. Belts are usually fitted to the smallest part of your waist. As mentioned, I used the [11 strand flat braid](https://www.paracordguild.com/11-strand-flat-braid-gaucho-style/) to make the belt.

![belt end tip|500](https://www.paracordguild.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/belt-end-tip-1024x545.jpg)

When done, you can use a belt end tip to easily finish your belt. I’d recommend at least 1 1/2 inch wide tips.

I hope this gives you a few ideas on how to make or improve your braided belts.
